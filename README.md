# Automobilhaus (Automobile house)
This application automatically imports specific customer and vehicle informations from configurable XML-Files-Paths. It mainly uses the SAX Parser and only persists new data in a database (h2). The imports are registered with hash values (sha256) and also persisted in the database in order to detect efficiently duplicate imports. The enduser can interact with a GUI to fulfill certain CRUD operations and can also produce a letter for one customer in order to inform him about all available vehicles. In order to run Application.java sucessfully, be sure, that you include the driver for H2 in your Maven repository and at least the iText 5 version.
